* Refactor [lexp] to [exp]

Using modules to deal with namespace conflicts when importing both
CoreDF and Minimp

* Remove call to decision procedures in [Correctness.v]
* Define a [Sampling] type-class

We can sample streams and histories. We would like to do so using a
single, common notation.

* Remove [sem_var_instant]

It's not really a semantic rule.

* Remove the [rhs_absent_instant] predicate

It is just used re-stating the fact that, if the base clock is
[false], the equations do not produce any ouput. At the moment, the
proof uses it as an indirection to use that result.

* Type of CoreDF programs

Do we stick with [Global]? What did we use in the paper?

* Grep for "XXX:"  and "TODO:"
